    "section": "",
    "text": "The blog post “Building a Brand as a Scientist” by Stephanie Hicks really impressed me with how important it is to realize what I want my professional identity to be. One question that stood out to me was, “What do I want to be known for?” I want to be recognized as a scientist who makes data understandable and actionable, especially in the field of public health. I believe in the power of data to bring about positive change, and I want to use my skills to improve community health outcomes and promote evidence-based decision-making.\nAnother aspect that resonated with me was how we need to identify our audience. My audience includes both scientific peers and the general public. I want to communicate science in a way that breaks down barriers, making complex ideas more accessible, especially among aging people. By doing so, I aim to bridge the gap between academic research and public understanding, inspiring informed discussions on health and well-being."
